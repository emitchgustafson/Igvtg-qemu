If you are looking for the qemu read me view "QEMU-README" theis is a readme for this fork.

This fork is designed to be used for upgrading XenGT's qemu to newer versions of qemu (and ubuntu)
This is part of a project upgrading Igvt's xen, kernel and qemu to newer versions

Current changes:
build without werror - there is depreciated class on 16.04 so werror causes qemu not to build, removing werror fixes this for now
